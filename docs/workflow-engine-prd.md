# Workflow Engine and Process Streaming Backend - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
A Python-based workflow engine and process streaming backend application designed for seamless integration with n8n and other external services. The system provides real-time workflow orchestration, data processing capabilities, and comprehensive API management for automated business processes.

The platform solves the challenge of complex workflow automation by offering a scalable, extensible backend that can handle both simple task automation and complex multi-step processes with real-time data streaming capabilities.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles
| Role | Registration Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| System Admin | Direct database setup | Full system access, user management, system configuration |
| Workflow Developer | API key registration | Create, modify, and deploy workflows, access development APIs |
| Service User | Token-based authentication | Execute workflows, view execution status, access assigned workflows |
| Integration Service | Service account setup | API access for external integrations, webhook management |

### 2.2 Feature Module
Our workflow engine consists of the following main components:
1. **Workflow Management Dashboard**: workflow creation, workflow templates, execution monitoring, performance analytics.
2. **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints, webhook management, authentication, rate limiting.
3. **Process Streaming Interface**: real-time data processing, event streaming, message queuing, data transformation.
4. **Integration Hub**: n8n connector, external service adapters, custom integration builder, webhook receivers.
5. **Execution Engine**: workflow orchestration, task scheduling, error handling, retry mechanisms.
6. **Monitoring & Logging**: execution logs, performance metrics, alert system, audit trails.

## 3. Core Process

**Workflow Developer Flow:**
1. Developer accesses Workflow Management Dashboard
2. Creates new workflow or selects template from Template Library
3. Configures workflow steps, triggers, and actions using Workflow Builder
4. Tests workflow execution through Execution Monitor
5. Deploys workflow to production environment
6. Monitors performance through Analytics Dashboard

**Integration Service Flow:**
1. External service (n8n or other) sends webhook to API Gateway
2. API Gateway authenticates request and routes to appropriate handler
3. Integration Hub processes the request and triggers workflow
4. Execution Engine orchestrates workflow steps
5. Process Streaming Interface handles real-time data processing
6. Results are sent back to requesting service or stored for later retrieval

**System Admin Flow:**
1. Admin accesses system through administrative interface
2. Manages user accounts and permissions
3. Configures system settings and integration parameters
4. Monitors system health through Monitoring & Logging
5. Manages service accounts and API keys
